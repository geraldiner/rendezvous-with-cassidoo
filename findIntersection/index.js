/**
 * Given two arrays A and B, return the indices at which the two arrays intersect. If the two arrays have no intersection at all, return null. Extra credit: how would you change your code if they were linked lists instead of arrays, if the input were the two head nodes, and you returned the intersection node?
 *
 * Example:
 * let listA = [1,4,5,6]
 * let listB = [2,3,4,5,6]
 *
 * findIntersection(listA, listB)
 * [1, 2]
