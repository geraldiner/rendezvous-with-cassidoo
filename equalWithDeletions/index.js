/**
 * Given two strings n and m, return true if they are equal when both are entered into text editors. But: a # means a backspace character (deleting backwards), and a % means a delete character (deleting forwards).
 *
 * Example
 * equalWithDeletions("a##x", "#a#x")
 * => true      // both strings become "x"
 *
 * equalWithDeletions("fi##f%%%th %%year #time###", "fifth year time")
 * => false     // the first string becomes "fart"
